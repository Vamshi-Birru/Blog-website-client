# Blog App Frontend

## Overview

This project is the frontend part of a blog application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). This frontend interacts with the backend to provide functionalities such as user authentication and CRUD operations for blog posts.

### Features:
- User authentication (signup and login)
- Displaying and managing blog posts
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile

## Setup and Run Locally

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)

### Cloning the Repository

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Vamshi-Birru/Blog-website-client
    cd Blog-website-frontend
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the frontend development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

   The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Approach and Challenges

### Approach

- **Frontend:** Built with React and Redux for state management. Used React Router for routing and Axios for API calls to interact with the backend.
- **Authentication:** On login, the frontend receives a `user_id` from the backend (generated by MongoDB), which is managed in the Redux state.

### Challenges Faced

- **Authentication:** Handling user sessions and securely managing the `user_id` in Redux state.
- **State Management:** Ensuring proper state management and data flow between the frontend and backend using Redux.
- **Integration:** Synchronizing frontend and backend development, and ensuring seamless communication between them.

## Backend

The frontend interacts with a separate backend API. Ensure that the backend server is running at the specified URL.
